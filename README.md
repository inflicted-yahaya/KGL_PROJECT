## Code Quality and Formatting

In this session, I integrated **ESLint** and **Prettier** to ensure code consistency and catch errors early.

### Tools Used:

- **ESLint**: For identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.
- **Prettier**: For automated code formatting.
- **VS Code Integration**: Enabled "Format on Save" for an automated workflow.

### Issues Fixed:

- **Inconsistent Indentation**: Standardized to 2 spaces.
- **Quote Usage**: Converted double quotes to single quotes.
- **Missing Semicolons**: Added required semicolons at the end of statements.
- **Logical Errors**: Identified unused variables and replaced `var` with `let/const`.
